    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools‚Äîsuch as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you‚Äôll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML‚Äîlaying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "‚úÖ Final answer:\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae have been used to gain insights into the physical processes and characteristics of these stellar phenomena. Below, I summarize some key studies and findings on this topic based on recent literature from arXiv.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **T Pyxidis Observations**:\n",
      "   - In \"The 2011 Outburst of Recurrent Nova T Pyx: Radio Observations Reveal the Ejecta Mass and Hint at Complex Mass Loss\" by Nelson et al. (2012), the authors use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to track the evolution of ejecta during T Pyx's outburst. They discovered that radio emissions are consistent with thermal emissions from nova ejecta, with a massive ejection estimated at 1‚Äì30 x 10^{-5} solar masses, indicating complex mass-loss processes [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3112v2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **V745 Sco Analysis**:\n",
      "   - \"Early multiwavelength analysis of the recurrent nova V745 Sco\" by Delgado and Hernanz (2019) provides a multiwavelength analysis of V745 Sco's 2014 outburst. Radio and infrared data were crucial for understanding the forward shock velocity and its magnetic field, alongside other collected X-ray data, indicative of particle acceleration processes [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08940v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **V3890 Sagitarii Observations**:\n",
      "   - \"Synchrotron emission from double-peaked radio light curves of the symbiotic recurrent nova V3890 Sagitarii\" by Nyamai et al. (2023) examined the nova V3890 Sagitarii via MeerKAT and VLA at various GHz frequencies. The radio light curves suggested that synchrotron emission from interacting nova ejecta with a companion's wind was significant, indicating complex dynamics and mass ejection measures relevant for understanding supernova type Ia progenitors [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09116v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **General Review of Recurrent Novae**:\n",
      "   - Koji Mukai's review \"Recurrent Novae - A Review\" discusses recurrent nova eruptions across various wavelengths including radio, emphasizing complex envelope ejection mechanisms, especially as observed in T Pyx, challenging traditional nova models [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4526v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **X-ray and Radio Studies**:\n",
      "   - The study \"X-ray emission from classical and recurrent-novae observed with ROSAT\" by Orio et al. (2001) also explores X-ray emissions associated with shocks in nova ejecta and connects these with any radio findings where relevant, broadening the understanding of novae's physical environments [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104219v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are crucial for understanding the complex mass-loss processes and interactions in recurrent novae. They help in constraining the ejected mass, velocity of ejecta, and provide insights into particle acceleration processes, which are vital for understanding nova physics and their potential as progenitors for other astrophysical phenomena like supernovae. Each study contributes unique insights, revealing the multifaceted nature of these cosmic explosions.\n",

    "## Exercise 2: Reflection + Rewrite\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Implement `reflection_and_rewrite(report)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report. This involves two main tasks: crafting a precise prompt and setting up a correctly configured response call to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a User Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Guide the language model to output a structured response in JSON format.\n",
    "- **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `\"reflection\"` and `\"revised_report\"`.\n",
    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these steps, your function will effectively transform and improve the given reports. Handle JSON parsing carefully to ensure the output is valid and reliable. Happy coding!"
